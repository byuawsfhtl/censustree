    <h1>Methods</h1> 
    <p>
        <p>This project creates an infrastructure for transcribing and 
            linking together large collections of handwritten historical 
            documents using deep machine learning and crowdsourced 
            human resources. 
            Our project is informed by other initiatives that take 
            advantage of recent advances in data science, computer vision, 
            and machine learning to extract text from 
            historical images, convert that text into usable data, 
            and link the individuals in the record to other collections. 
         </p>
         <p>   
            Our work complements 
            these efforts, and allows us to 
            dramatically advance the frontier in this area. 
            Our partnership with FamilySearch.org, the largest genealogical 
            research organization in the world, allows us to access the 
            largest-ever corpus of labeled handwriting images from historical 
            records (1 billion+). 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Because the users of these genealogy 
            platforms have themselves created millions of record links using their 
            private information, we have access to a massive database of 
            “true” links that can inform our data cleaning processes and act as training 
            data to improve the machine learning algorithms that are part of our 
            linking strategy. 
        </p>
        <p>   
            With these advantages, we have created a digitized, 
            longitudinal panel of linked census records that includes each of 
            the 217 million people who lived in the United States between 1850 and 
            1950. For the majority of these we will be able to link individuals 
            across multiple censuses and across families, and we will extend this 
            effort to other publicly available record collections. 
            We will make the tools and training data that we create easy to access 
            and use by other researchers and the general public.
